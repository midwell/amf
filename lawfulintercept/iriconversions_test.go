// Every value this element puts into a TS 33.128 record arrives through a conversion into one
// of `li/iri`'s types, and two of those conversions have already been defects.
//
// `handoverCause` cast NGAP's cause value straight into the record type — every handover record
// delivered before 2026-08-20 carried the wrong cause. `handoverType` cast NGAP's handover type
// the same way, and `intra5gs(0)` made every intra-5GS handover record undecodable on receipt.
// Both were found by a delivered record being wrong, one of them weeks after the fact, and
// `PDUSessionType` was found by reading. **None of those is a check**, so the next raw cast into
// a record enumeration would arrive exactly the same way.
//
// **This keys on the shape, not on a list of enumerations.** The tempting design is "for each
// known `iri` enum type, require an assertion", and that list is the thing that goes stale: a
// new enumeration in `li` is invisible to a list maintained here. Inverted, the staleness works
// for us — every conversion `iri.T(x)` whose argument is not one of the package's own `iri.`
// constants must be recorded, so a new enumerated conversion arrives as an unlisted site rather
// than as a type nobody added.
//
// Same trade as `li/iri`'s `unrestrictedBareFields`: a one-time cost of writing the entries, for
// the next one being a decision rather than a diff nobody reads.
//
// **What it cannot see**, said out loud because the gap is real: an *implicit* conversion. A
// function declared to return `iri.AccessType` that writes `return 0` produces a value of that
// type with no conversion expression for this scan to find, and `DeregistrationScope` in this
// package does exactly that — deliberately, with both callers expected to notice the zero and
// substitute the arrival access. The encode-time guard in `li/iri` is what covers those, and the two halves
// are complementary rather than redundant — this one catches an unasserted correspondence, that
// one catches a value the enumeration does not define however it got there.

// conversionKind is what an entry claims about the conversion.
