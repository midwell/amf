// NGAP and TS 33.128 describe the same five Cause groups and number them differently: NGAP
// from zero, TS 33.128 from one. So a cause read off the wire is *not* the value a handover
// record carries, and for a long time this element emitted it as though it were — every cause
// one below the value TS 33.128 defines for it, and NGAP's `unspecified(0)` emitted as a zero
// that the record's own enumeration does not include.
//
// **That failure is the worst-behaved kind available on this interface.** A misnumbered cause
// is a plausible member of the right enumeration, so it decodes, validates and is stored: a
// mediation function cannot tell it from the cause that actually occurred, and neither can this
// element. Nothing on the wire or in either party's records distinguishes "the network gave
// this reason" from "the network gave the reason one along".
//
// **The correspondence is `NGAP + 1` wherever one exists, and the interesting part is where one
// does not.** Every value TS 33.128 defines sits one above the NGAP value for the same cause —
// all 48 of the radio-network pairs, and every pair in the other four groups. What arithmetic
// cannot supply is the list below: NGAP values that TS 33.128 has no value for at all, either
// because the specification omitted one (the radio-network enumeration runs 1..52 with 28
// absent) or because NGAP has been extended since the release this element's module is from.
// Those are the values a shift would carry into a number the record's enumeration does not
// define, and they are the reason this is a function rather than an expression.
//
// The names in the comments are what makes the arithmetic checkable:
// TestTheCauseMappingIsTotalOverNGAP derives the correspondence from the two definitions *by
// name* — the TS 33.128 module carried in the pinned `li` module, and the NGAP constants — and
// asserts this function agrees with it. So the implementation is arithmetic and a list, and its
// test's source of truth is neither.

// unrepresentableRadioNetwork are the NGAP CauseRadioNetwork values TS 33.128 has no value for.
//
//	27 — unkownQosFlowID. The value TS 33.128 skipped: its enumeration has no 28, and every
//	     value above it stays aligned at NGAP+1, so the omission is this one cause and not a
//	     renumbering.
//	52 — redcapUeNotSupported
//	53 — unknownMBSSessionID
//	54 — indicatedMBSSessionAreaInformationNotServedByTheGNB
//	55 — inconsistentSliceInfoForTheSession
//	56 — misalignedAssociationForMulticastUnicast
//	57 — eredcapUeNotSupported

// later release that adds them will show up as this list being wrong, in the test rather than
// on the wire.

// a gNB built to a later release can send a value above what this module knows, and the decoder
// carries it up rather than rejecting it.

// **It is the sharper of the two defects, and it was found by decoding a delivered record
// rather than by reading a specification.** TS 33.128 numbers the four values 1..4; NGAP numbers
// them 0..3. So an intra-5GS handover — the ordinary case — was emitted as `handoverType: 0`,
// which the arm's enumeration does not define at all. `handoverCause` at least produced a
// plausible member of the right enumeration; this produces a record a conformant mediation
// function **cannot decode**, and `handoverType` is mandatory in both records that carry it. The
// project's own ASN.1 decoder refuses it:
//
//	XIRIPayload.event.aMFRANHandoverCommand.handoverType:
//	  Expected enumeration value 1, 2, 3 or 4, but got 0
//
// So every intra-5GS handover record delivered before 2026-08-20 was discarded on receipt. Total
// product loss for those records, with this element believing it had delivered and no fault
// raised at either end.
//
// **The constraint check could not catch it, and the reason is worth stating.** It treats zero
// as absence — correctly for an optional member, whose unset value reads as zero in Go — so a
// mandatory member emitted as zero is indistinguishable from one legitimately omitted. That
// exemption is what let both this and the cause defect through, and it is why `iri` now records
// per type whether zero is a legitimate reading.
