// NetworkInitiatedDeregistrationProcedure branches on whether the UE is connected and registered.
// The report sat on the `else` arm — the one *not* taken in the ordinary case — under a comment
// asserting that the taken arm left the UE attached and so was not a deregistration. It is one:
// the UE answers with a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT, HandleDeregistrationAccept runs, the state becomes
// Deregistered, and every SM context is released below the branch on both arms. So a target the
// network forcibly deregistered produced no AMFDeregistration and no AMFIdentifierDeassociation,
// and was indistinguishable to the agency from one that simply went quiet.
//
// The rule this encodes: the obligation belongs where the procedure *completes*, not where it is
// started. A branch chosen at the beginning of a procedure may complete it by another route.
//
// A behavioural assertion would need a production seam in this package to observe the call —
// lawfulintercept.ReportDeregistration is called directly rather than through a package variable.
// This is the cheaper half of that trade and is the half that would have caught the defect.
